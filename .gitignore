# Electron build ignores (using electron-builder)
# --------------------
/dist
/build
!.gitkeep
# The `dist` directory is the standard output for built Electron apps, while `build` is

# `!.gitkeep` is a common practice to keep an empty directory tracked.

# NativePHP ignores
# --------------------
/vendor/nativephp
/resources/js/resources/*
# NativePHP installs its own `vendor` directory and other resources. You should typically
# ignore these to allow team members to run `composer install` for their own setup.
# Exclude the `vendor/nativephp` directory entirely to prevent committing internal NativePHP dependencies.
